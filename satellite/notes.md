Landsat-8

Landsat-8 is the newest satellite in NASA's decades-old Landsat program, which launched in XXX. It orbits the Earth in a XXX pattern, allowing it to capture

Useful for:
  * Point-in-time imagery of basically every spot on Earth
  * Detailed, high-res imagery down to 15m/pixel (via pansharpening)
  * Year-over-year comparisons (or maybe month-over-month if you're lucky)

Drawbacks:
  * Only passes over each spot about once a month
  * Often those passes feature clouds, which makes comparisons difficult

Processing notes:

Most of the time, you'll probably use Landsat to create true-color images of different places on Earth. 


GOES-16

GOES-16 is a new weather satellite launched in 2016. Along with its Japanese cousin, Himiwari-8, it provides the most detailed and high-res images of things like storms and clouds, as well as many bands of data valuable for weather forecasting and remote sensing.

It sits in geostationary orbit and only records observations of the Western hemisphere, including the continental United States. But it's super fast, grabbing new images every 15 minutes.

Useful for:
  * Making beautiful animations of clouds, storms and smoke from forest fires
  * Anything where you need real-time satellite observations of the U.S. in infrared or near-infrared bands (snow cover modeling, vegetation indexes, monitoring fires, etc.)

Drawbacks:
  * Not nearly as detailed as things like Landsat. Can't zoom in and see cities, for example.

Processing notes:

GOES-16 does not have an actual green band, which means that one has to be synthesized from other bands in order to create true-color imagery.
