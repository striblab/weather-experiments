# Weather data experiments

Experimenting with visualizing weather data in striking ways, including:

  * Ways to visualize snowfall accumulation
  * Voronoi and hex maps for binning weather observations
  * Animated satellite imagery

Basically just a playground for now. Readmes detailing each experiment are in the folders. Much more TK.
